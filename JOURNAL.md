# may 8th: Got the screen to work! 
Created the project and placed down all the components for the schematic, and wired them together. 
Once finished, turned the schematic into a PCB. Realized I had chosen the wrong resistor, 
went back and redid the resistor wiring (made a mental note to emphasize the component selection 
aspect during the workshop on Thursday). Finished the outline of the PCB and started figuring out the 
placement of components on the board.
