# may 8th: started the project! 
Created the project and populated the schematic with all necessary components, wiring them accordingly. After completing the schematic, converted it into a PCB layout.
Noticed an incorrect resistor selection, so I updated the schematic and rewired the resistor appropriately. (Made a mental note to highlight the importance of careful
component selection during Thursday's workshop.) Finalized the PCB outline and began organizing component placement on the board.
