# may 8th: started the project! 
Created the project and populated the schematic with all necessary components, wiring them accordingly. After completing the schematic, converted it into a PCB layout.
Noticed an incorrect resistor selection, so I updated the schematic and rewired the resistor appropriately. (Made a mental note to highlight the importance of careful
component selection during Thursday's workshop.) Finalized the PCB outline and began organizing component placement on the board.

# may 29th: added colour and secound led.
i spent a bit of time changing the colours and updating the schematic to have 2 leds instead of only one. customizing this to be my very own.
i also made it so that the solder mask layer would come through and make my pictures stand out.
